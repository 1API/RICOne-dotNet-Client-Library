# RICOne API .NET Client Library
The RICOne .NET Client Library was developed using .NET 4 and RestSharp (http://restsharp.org/).

### Features
* Makes calls to the RICOne API using the xPress model in .NET projects
* User can login to the authentication server using credentials to retrieve provider information
* Uses POCO object responses

#### Basic Use
```csharp
Authenticator auth = Authenticator.Instance;
auth.Authenticate(authUrl, clientId, clientSecret);

foreach (Endpoint e in auth.GetEndpoints())
{
	XPress xPress = new XPress(e.href);
}
```

### Project Contents
