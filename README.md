# RICOne API .NET Client Library
The RICOne .NET Client Library was developed using .NET 4 and RestSharp (http://restsharp.org/).

### Features
* Makes calls to the RICOne API using the SIFxPress model in .NET projects
* User can login to OAuth server using credentials to retrieve provider information
* Uses POCO object responses

#### Basic Use
```csharp
Authenticator auth = new Authenticator(username, password);

foreach (Endpoint e in auth.GetEndpoints())
{
	RicOneApiClient ricOne = new RicOneApiClient(e);
}
```
